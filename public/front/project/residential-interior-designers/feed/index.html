		<description><![CDATA[<p>Interior design of marketing suite and 215-apartment luxury residential development for client Chartered Land in the prestigious Ballsbridge area of Dublin. The 14m-high, three-storey marketing suite is now open for the phased selling of the development, with the first apartments ready in 2018, ranging from one-bed, two-bed and three-bed apartments to penthouses. The interior concept references nearby Georgian and Victorian properties in terms of proportions and finishes and is rich and contemporary in feel, with granite balconies, solid walnut units, marble or natural stone bathrooms and the most exclusive kitchens ever offered in the Irish residential apartment sector.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>One Park Drive is one of London’s most exciting and eagerly-awaited developments; an iconic new 58-storey residential building by international architects Herzog &#38; de Meuron in Canary Wharf’s New District. Goddard Littlefair has created the designs for two different areas of the three-section circular building, Cluster and Bay, with each typology comprised of studio, 1, 2 and 3-bed spaces.</p>
<p>The interiors concept was inspired by the use of framing in the architectural scheme, as well as the ribbed texture of the external façade, with echoed patterning used in the joinery for the crisp and geometric interior treatment, inspired by the architectural cues. The concept is very engineered, using exquisite details and making them flow and connect around the apartments.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>For independent real estate firm CIT, Goddard Littlefair was one of the leading design studios selected to create a show apartment for South Bank Tower: a ‘Black Edition’ duplex, spread over a west-facing corner location on the tower’s 36th and 37th floors.</p>
<p>The apartment’s spectacular views, especially of sunset, inspired a dramatic colour spectrum of rusts and ochres, grey, oyster, soft blues and teals. A hanging sculpture in the double-height living space forms a beautiful, transparent central feature.</p>
<p>South Bank Tower won gold at the 2016 London Design Awards for best Residential Interior Design.</p>
