		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Lowry Hotel’s 5-star, luxury Presidential Suite, the largest in Greater Manchester, has undergone a complete revamp including a complete reconfiguration of the space, including a newly-enlarged dressing room. Beautiful, fitted joinery screens create a series of distinct, but linked spaces, including a living area, dining area, bedroom, bathroom, dressing room, pantry and powder room.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Manchester’s rich industrial history, the suite makes reference to the city’s industrial forms, geometry and heritage, including the shape of Trinity Bridge, located directly outside the hotel. Accompanied by a colour palette inspired by Lowry’s five colours, the new design has a luxurious residential feel, with light and bright tonal colours used for the walls, curtains and carpets, offset by darker joinery, with painterly or geometric-patterned fabrics.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik, situated just above Dubrovnik old town, was originally built in the 1890s and went on to serve the great Mediterranean cruise liners docking in the city in the early 20th century. Originally named ‘The Imperial’, with a French Riviera feel and the glamorous cachet of an international clientele, the hotel was subsequently shelled during the Yugoslav war and used to house refugees. The brief to Goddard Littlefair is to restore completely the hotel’s original glamour, with a 1920s yachting influence and soft detailing.</p>

<p>Like a cosmopolitan clubhouse, the scheme is eclectic and intriguing and full of references to travel. The interior feel is plush and elegant, with interesting and varied furniture and tactile, high-quality fabrics, including richly-coloured velvets and leathers, all set within a series of stand-out individual spaces.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Goddard Littlefair’s first ever project with the InterContinental Hotel Group is the brand’s Berlin hotel, redesigning all public areas, F&#38;B spaces and guestrooms in line with IHG’s new brand guidelines. The general design scheme for the hotel takes reference from the building’s architectural fabric and surrounding architectural environment, paying particular attention to the mid-century concrete style. For the guest rooms, the look will be luxury, but with a domestic vernacular and a colour treatment that is mainly monochromatic with a touch of gold. Whilst, the colour scheme for the public areas takes inspiration from surrounding natural environment, particularly the autumnal Tiergarten situated next to the hotel.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>For The Principal York, we created a scheme designed to breathe life back into every artery, giving a nod to tradition, whilst creating a light, welcoming and contemporary environment in the form of a modern and softer country house interior.</p>
<p>We were asked to reinstate the hotel’s essential character to help position it as a great destination to spend time in, as well as being a great place for visitors to stay in, located right alongside York railway station.</p>
<p>The Principal York had a double victory at the 2016 Visit York Tourism awards, winning gold for Hotel of the Year and Conference Venue of the Year, and also won gold at the 2016 London Design Awards for Hospitality Interior Design.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Principal Edinburgh George Street is a classic Georgian town house hotel, made up of five individual townhouses and situated in Edinburgh’s new town, famously designed by the architect Robert Adam.</p>
<p>Designed and curated to reflect its Georgian heritage, a collection of classic furniture evokes the local cityscape through a rich palette of colours and textures, whilst an undertone of edgy, industrial-inspired detailing and finishes reflect the site’s former usage as a printing press and the changing city all around.</p>
<p>This project won the 5* award for Best Hotel Interiors, Scotland, at the International Property Awards 2016, UK.</p>
