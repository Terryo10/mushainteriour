		<description><![CDATA[<p>Juliet Rose is a striking destination bar, located on the ground floor of the Hilton Hotel Munich City. The design scheme was inspired by the F&#38;B concept of unusual botanical extracts and the importance of process in the creation of its singular ‘root to fruit’ drinks, which includes a range of signature cocktails and what is said to be the best coffee in Munich. The theatrical zoned space has an alchemical, laboratory feel; creating a perfect back-drop for outstanding drinks to be made and delivered.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>‘The Garden’ at The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square is a destination all-day food and beverage space for hotel guests and an oasis for local Edinburgh residents, featuring a new glazed roof for all-year use and a design inspired by the great hothouses, orangeries and nurseries of grand, historic country estates. A deliberately eclectic and varied approach was taken to the scheme’s furnishings and accessories to give the impression of an ensemble of pieces acquired by the owner of the ‘house’ over a period of many years.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>BABA is a destination restaurant and cocktail bar in The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel, with both offers under the direction of Jonathan MacDonald and Daniel Spurr from hit Glasgow restaurant Ox and Finch, in partnership with restaurant and bar visionaries Robbie Bargh from Gorgeous Group and Katherine Arnold. BABA offers a boldly unconventional menu of small plate mezze dining and the restaurant’s unique twist is the flavour of ‘Levantine escapism’. The main area features a vibrant colour scheme and an industrial, distressed design feel, with strong elements of the Levantine in terms of colours and detailing.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>BABA Bar is a destination cocktail bar within The Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel, adjacent to the BABA restaurant. A specially-commissioned mural of the ‘host’, Mr Baba, provides the backdrop to the bar counter, whilst the interiors concept includes a mix of new and refurbished items to suggest a previous life, from the re-finished, dark-stained, timber bar front and re-used zinc bar top to the new mesh and scaffolding gantry above the bar counter, plus a new, poured concrete floor, decorated with a stencilled repeat motif.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Garden Room, part of the refurbishment of the Royal York Hotel, is a particular highlight: a beautiful lounge space, complete with Chesterfield sofas and wing chairs, making it the perfect place to relax and enjoy afternoon tea.</p>
<p>The lounge also re-establishes the tradition of the state room and gives the hotel back its beating heart. A sense of place is incorporated throughout, including artworks and images referencing York Races and society gatherings involving the Duke and Duchess of York.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A new, 92-cover, 186 sq m bar, plus a 116-cover, 207 sq m restaurant, under the direction of chef-restaurateur Des McDonald, with a grill-brasserie feel, designed to offer maximum adaptability in order to attract day and night-time visitors with the full impact of a destination space.</p>
<p>Our design approach was to be highly respectful to the building’s original fabric, as well as to the late Victorian insertions, restoring grandeur and creating an environment that instantly feels long-established.</p>
<p>This project won the Best Restaurant or Bar in  Hotel category at the 2016 Restaurant &#38; Bar Design Awards and won the silver award for Hospitality Interior Design at the 2016 London Design Awards.</p>
