		<description><![CDATA[<p>New destination bar Juliet Rose, designed by Goddard Littlefair, is now open at Hilton Hotel Munich City. The bar’s name is taken from one of the most elite roses in the world, developed by renowned rose breeder David Austin. As well as lending the concept connotations of craftsmanship, the ‘Rose’ reference is a nod to Rosenheimer Strasse the street onto which the bar’s dedicated entrance faces and Rosenheimer Platz metro station on top of which the hotel stands.</p>
<p>The scheme was inspired by the F&#38;B concept of unusual botanical extracts and the importance of process in the creation of its singular drinks, which includes a range of signature cocktails and what is said to be the best coffee in Munich. The result is an exciting and theatrical zoned space with an alchemical, laboratory feel; a perfect back-drop for outstanding drinks to be made and delivered.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In this month’s Interior Designer magazine, Co-founder and Director Martin Goddard was invited to share his definition of what hospitality means to him.</p>
<p><em>“The house we live in is a former coaching inn and would once have welcomed weary travellers with a smile, a bed, stable for the horse, a roaring fire and a flagon of mead. The essence of hospitality is unchanging. It&#8217;s about feeling comfortable and special, about interacting with people and break down barriers, with your host coming out from behind the counter to welcome you. If we can create memorable backdrops for the best doormen and maitre d’s to greet their customers warmly, I’m happy.&#8221; </em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Lowry Hotel in Manchester has unveiled the brand-new design of its 5-star, luxury Presidential Suite, the largest in Greater Manchester. Goddard Littlefair were thrilled to be involved in this prestigious project, using a place-making, story-telling approach to connect the look and feel of the suite to the city and to Lowry himself.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Manchester’s rich industrial history, the suite makes reference to the city’s industrial forms, geometry and heritage, including the shape of Trinity Bridge, located directly outside the hotel. Accompanied by a colour palette inspired by Lowry’s five colours, including Yellow Ochre and Prussian Blue, the new design has a luxurious residential feel, with light and bright tonal colours used for the walls, curtains and carpets, offset by darker joinery, with painterly or geometric-patterned fabrics. The completion of the hotel’s presidential suite will be followed by a revamp of the hotel’s lobby and reception, as well as a new look restaurant and bar later this year, </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Lowry Hotel in Manchester has unveiled the brand-new design of its 5-star, luxury Presidential Suite, the largest in Greater Manchester. Goddard Littlefair were thrilled to be involved in this prestigious project, using a place-making, story-telling approach to connect the look and feel of the suite to the city and to Lowry himself.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Manchester’s rich industrial history, the suite makes reference to the city’s industrial forms, geometry and heritage, including the shape of Trinity Bridge, located directly outside the hotel. Accompanied by a colour palette inspired by Lowry’s five colours, including Yellow Ochre and Prussian Blue, the new design has a luxurious residential feel, with light and bright tonal colours used for the walls, curtains and carpets, offset by darker joinery, with painterly or geometric-patterned fabrics. The completion of the hotel’s presidential suite will be followed by a revamp of the hotel’s lobby and reception, as well as a new look restaurant and bar later this year, also designed by Goddard Littlefair.</p>

<p>Goddard Littlefair Co-founder and Director Jo Littlefair was asked to share her expertise on how to use lighting to create ambience and warmth within the home. <em>“Spotlighting ceilings to death is definitely considered a faux pas when there are so many more intelligent ways to use lighting,”</em>Jo comments, referring to the use of hidden-track lighting in the apartments at One Park Drive, an example of a more subtle form of architectural lighting using directional lights to highlight key elements within the room. <em><a href="http://www.goddardlittlefair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/JAN-The-Times-Bricks-Mortar-One-Park-Drive.jpg"><strong>Click here</strong></a> </em>for the full article.</p>

Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik, situated just above Dubrovnik old town, was originally built in the 1890s and went on to serve the great Mediterranean cruise liners docking in the city in the early 20th century.

<p>Goddard Littlefair was commissioned for a phased set of redesign works, with the first two now completed and including the reception and lobby, The Lobby Lounge, The Imperial Bar, The Executive Lounge, all connecting and guest-room corridors and all of the hotel’s 149 standard and executive rooms and 9 suites. A refurbishment of the hotel’s existing restaurant, Porat, on the lower-ground floor, will follow in late 2019.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hans’ Bar &#38; Grill, a new neighbourhood restaurant in Chelsea’s Pavilion Road designed by Goddard Littlefair, is now open. The 106-cover venue, conceived of by the team behind Chewton Glen, Lygon Arms, Cliveden and 11 Cadogan Gardens, is made up of a café-bar and extended restaurant, including a wine display area and newly-covered former courtyard space, within the 11 Cadogan Gardens hotel. The restaurant was named in honour of Cadogan family ascendant Sir Hans Sloane, one-time physician to the royal family and President of The Royal Society. This is Goddard Littlefair’s first restaurant project to open in the capital and a great opportunity to show clients a finished F&#38;B project in the same city we work, eat and sleep in – alongside our many completed London residential developments.</p>

Goddard Littlefair Co-Founder and Director Martin Goddard was invited to take part alongside some of the UK’s most prominent designers, brought together to share their thoughts about hospitality design, including trends, technology, heritage and the importance of lighting.</p>
<p>When discussing the topic of uniqueness, Martin suggested that people don’t recognise the brand of the hotel anymore, but instead how the location of the hotel is reflected in its design. <em>“This challenges hotel operators to rethink design, which is really exciting,” </em>he says.<em>“Instead of the brand dictating the design, the locale and heritage dictate the design, and the design consequently becomes the brand”.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In this month’s FX magazine, Susana Sousa, an architect at Goddard Littlefair, was invited to share her vision of luxury weekend escape pods ‘that rise above the grime and noise of urban life, once all work and tasks are completed for the week.’</p>
<p>FX Magazine’s ‘If Only…’ feature showcases the creative visions of designers and architects who are asked what they would create if there were no boundaries in design. ‘Guests would be shuttled up the tensile wire moorings in a mini-shunt, activated by personalised smart cards, before arriving at the centre of the hydrogen-powered structure,’ Susana explained. ‘There they would find a two-storey, solar-powered, fully stocked luxury apartment with dimmable, screened shutters for sleeping in and amazing views from the viewing platforms, thanks to the balloons’ mechanised setting, doing one entire rotation every 24 hours’.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>One Park Drive, one of London’s most exciting and eagerly-awaited luxury residential developments, launches to the public on May 4th. A striking and soon-to-be iconic 58-storey circular building by Tate Modern architects Herzog &#38; de Meuron, One Park Drive is the first UK residential project by the practice and will be comprised of three apartment typologies – Bay, Cluster and Loft – with all the designs for the Bay and Cluster sections created by Goddard Littlefair. Inspired by the striking use of frames and ribbed textures in the building façade, the interior designs will be crisp and geometric, with an accent on clean lines. The refined and understated colour palettes will be given added drama through shape, texture and finely-judged bolts of vivid colour.</p>

First of all, our refurbishment of Principal York, the former Royal York Hotel, took gold in the ‘Interior Design – Hospitality’ category (adding to its ‘Hotel of the Year’ win at the Visit York Tourism Awards), with our restaurant and bar, The Printing Press, at the Principal Edinburgh hotel, taking silver in the same category.  The Printing Press was also a winner earlier this year at the Restaurant &#38; Bar Design Awards. Finally, in the ‘Interior Design – Residential’ category of the awards, whilst our stunning show flat for developer CIT at South Bank Tower took the gold award too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the world’s – and certainly the UK’s &#8211; most famous hotels, The Gleneagles Hotel, has announced the completion of the first phase of its redevelopment. Goddard Littlefair is delighted to have been involved in this project, redesigning 35 luxury bedrooms and suites and linking corridors. Our inspiration for the room transformations came from seeing the hotel for the very first time; taking in its scale, presence, grandeur and location, with rolling Scottish hills and an amazing palette of natural colours in every direction. </p>
<p>Our design treatment is rich, varied and interesting with a clear narrative direction and strong connections to the location in terms of materials, colours and art. Guests feel connected to the past via the intrigue and interest of the antiques and art, but also encounter the highest standards of contemporary luxury wherever they look and whatever they touch.</p>
