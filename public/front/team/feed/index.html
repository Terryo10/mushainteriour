		<description><![CDATA[<p>Goddard Littlefair Creative Director Richard McCready-Hughes ensures the highest design values and maximum creativity on all our projects, from concept to delivery, and is committed to getting the best out of our talented studio team. Notable residential and hospitality projects that have benefitted from his eye include the South Bank Tower Show Apartment, a gold winner at the 2016 London Design Awards and 2017’s complete refurbishment of the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square Hotel.</p>
<p>Richard oversees the whole design process, but always relishes the concept phase and his initial exposure to the client vision. He considers the design process an exercise in interpretation and his great experience, coupled with his natural sense of style, ensures that the final environments we deliver not only please, but delight. In 2017, Richard was asked to judge a wide range of design schemes in the independent hospitality sector for the Design Vision Style Awards.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Senior Associate Tom Blackshaw is a hospitality and high-end residential specialist, who graduated in 2000 and then worked in London for an initial five-year period on varied hospitality projects before moving to Australia. For the next 13 years, whilst based in Sydney, Tom worked on award-winning projects throughout the Asia-Pacific region &#8211; including Australia’s largest new-build hotel, the Darling Harbour Sofitel &#8211; for hotel brands including Hyatt, Hilton, Sheraton, Accor, Marriott, Starwood, IHG and Shangri-La, as well as on luxury residential developer projects in Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Tom’s core strength is planning and the operational side of delivering projects. He especially enjoys the harmonious dovetailing of these aspects into exciting final designs and involvement on projects right up to cutting the ribbon. Tom also enjoys working with trades on-site and believes that having the greatest respect for everyone involved in a project helps bring about the most holistic and harmonious end results.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Senior Associate and architect David Lee Hood joined Goddard Littlefair in 2013 and heads up the studio’s architectural offer. As a flexible all-rounder, David splits his energies equally between hospitality projects, including international hotel and restaurant schemes, such as the Restaurant &#38; Bar Design Award-winning venue, The Printing Press for Principal or the award-winning refurbishment of The Gleneagles Hotel, and major residential developments for clients such as St Edwards and St James, part of Berkeley Group.</p>
<p>David’s flexibility, capability and breadth of experience sees him involved in every aspect of architecture and design across our projects, but always with a creative focus. He relishes variety, from client-facing presentations to project-managing and problem-solving on site. David studied architecture in Newcastle and Glasgow and took his RIBA Part III once his career was already well underway at a number of leading London signature-designer studios, where his work has always been focused on the high-end sector.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Associate Graham Stanmore is a highly-experienced designer and hospitality expert, who has run his own company, as well as working for a number of industry giants in UK hospitality design and project management, over the course of a 30-year career. Graham has experience in retail and leisure, but the majority of his project work spans every aspect of hotel interiors, covering the design of guest rooms, meeting rooms, bars, restaurants, lobbies and public spaces for brands and operators including Millennium, CIT Group, Paramount, Stakis, Crowne Plaza, Hilton, Jumeirah Hotels and Resorts and Medina Hotels, right across the globe.</p>
<p>Whilst Graham loves getting major projects to the completion stage, his real passion is for concept design, the early stages of visualisation and the exploration of client briefs. Graham also enjoys drawing by hand and, away from the office, pursues a parallel career as a fine artist working both in portraiture and abstract landscapes.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Wilson joined Goddard Littlefair in 2016, working on high-end residential and spa projects, including One Blackfriars, as well as a number of major hotel projects. His experience lies in high-end residential and hospitality projects in locations across Europe and the Middle East, as well as North Africa and Asia, for leading hotel brands such as Hilton, Hyatt, Corinthia and Intercontinental.</p>
<p>Steve is very much an all-rounder, working from concept design to project management and delivery. He particularly enjoys the interior architectural side of projects, overseeing teams and working on project co-ordination with clients and consultants, as well as the satisfaction of creating perfect fine-detailing, even when only visible under close inspection. Steve is always on the look-out for new materials and innovations and considers sketching a total joy. He is a great advocate for the power of a sketch to communicate concepts quickly, especially to non-designers.</p>
