		<description><![CDATA[<p>Juliet Rose is a striking destination bar, located on the ground floor of the Hilton Hotel Munich City. The design scheme was inspired by the F&#38;B concept of unusual botanical extracts and the importance of process in the creation of its singular ‘root to fruit’ drinks, which includes a range of signature cocktails and what is said to be the best coffee in Munich. The theatrical zoned space has an alchemical, laboratory feel; creating a perfect back-drop for outstanding drinks to be made and delivered.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Lowry Hotel’s 5-star, luxury Presidential Suite, the largest in Greater Manchester, has undergone a complete revamp including a complete reconfiguration of the space, including a newly-enlarged dressing room. Beautiful, fitted joinery screens create a series of distinct, but linked spaces, including a living area, dining area, bedroom, bathroom, dressing room, pantry and powder room.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Manchester’s rich industrial history, the suite makes reference to the city’s industrial forms, geometry and heritage, including the shape of Trinity Bridge, located directly outside the hotel. Accompanied by a colour palette inspired by Lowry’s five colours, the new design has a luxurious residential feel, with light and bright tonal colours used for the walls, curtains and carpets, offset by darker joinery, with painterly or geometric-patterned fabrics.</p>

A deliberately eclectic and varied approach was taken to the scheme’s furnishings and accessories to give the impression of an ensemble of pieces acquired by the owner of the ‘house’ over a period of many years.</p>

BABA offers a boldly unconventional menu of small plate mezze dining and the restaurant’s unique twist is the flavour of ‘Levantine escapism’. The main area features a vibrant colour scheme and an industrial, distressed design feel, with strong elements of the Levantine in terms of colours and detailing.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik, situated just above Dubrovnik old town, was originally built in the 1890s and went on to serve the great Mediterranean cruise liners docking in the city in the early 20th century. Originally named ‘The Imperial’, with a French Riviera feel and the glamorous cachet of an international clientele, the hotel was subsequently shelled during the Yugoslav war and used to house refugees. The brief to Goddard Littlefair is to restore completely the hotel’s original glamour, with a 1920s yachting influence and soft detailing.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Goddard Littlefair’s first ever project with the InterContinental Hotel Group is the brand’s Berlin hotel, redesigning all public areas, F&#38;B spaces and guestrooms in line with IHG’s new brand guidelines. The general design scheme for the hotel takes reference from the building’s architectural fabric and surrounding architectural environment, paying particular attention to the mid-century concrete style. For the guest rooms, the look will be luxury, but with a domestic vernacular and a colour treatment that is mainly monochromatic with a touch of gold. Whilst, the colour scheme for the public areas takes inspiration from surrounding natural environment, particularly the autumnal Tiergarten situated next to the hotel.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>One Park Drive is one of London’s most exciting and eagerly-awaited developments; an iconic new 58-storey residential building by international architects Herzog &#38; de Meuron in Canary Wharf’s New District. Goddard Littlefair has created the designs for two different areas of the three-section circular building, Cluster and Bay, with each typology comprised of studio, 1, 2 and 3-bed spaces.</p>
<p>The interiors concept was inspired by the use of framing in the architectural scheme, as well as the ribbed texture of the external façade, with echoed patterning used in the joinery for the crisp and geometric interior treatment, inspired by the architectural cues. The concept is very engineered, using exquisite details and making them flow and connect around the apartments.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>One Park Drive is one of London’s most exciting and eagerly-awaited developments; an iconic new 58-storey residential building by international architects Herzog &#38; de Meuron in Canary Wharf’s New District. Goddard Littlefair has created the designs for two different areas of the three-section circular building, Cluster and Bay, with each typology comprised of studio, 1, 2 and 3-bed spaces.</p>
<p>The interiors concept was inspired by the use of framing in the architectural scheme, as well as the ribbed texture of the external façade, with echoed patterning used in the joinery for the crisp and geometric interior treatment, inspired by the architectural cues. The concept is very engineered, using exquisite details and making them flow and connect around the apartments.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>For independent real estate firm CIT, Goddard Littlefair was one of the leading design studios selected to create a show apartment for South Bank Tower: a ‘Black Edition’ duplex, spread over a west-facing corner location on the tower’s 36th and 37th floors.</p>
<p>The apartment’s spectacular views, especially of sunset, inspired a dramatic colour spectrum of rusts and ochres, grey, oyster, soft blues and teals. A hanging sculpture in the double-height living space forms a beautiful, transparent central feature.</p>
<p>South Bank Tower won gold at the 2016 London Design Awards for best Residential Interior Design.</p>

<p>We were asked to reinstate the hotel’s essential character to help position it as a great destination to spend time in, as well as being a great place for visitors to stay in, located right alongside York railway station.</p>
<p>The Principal York had a double victory at the 2016 Visit York Tourism awards, winning gold for Hotel of the Year and Conference Venue of the Year, and also won gold at the 2016 London Design Awards for Hospitality Interior Design.</p>

<p>Designed and curated to reflect its Georgian heritage, a collection of classic furniture evokes the local cityscape through a rich palette of colours and textures, whilst an undertone of edgy, industrial-inspired detailing and finishes reflect the site’s former usage as a printing press and the changing city all around.</p>
<p>This project won the 5* award for Best Hotel Interiors, Scotland, at the International Property Awards 2016, UK.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Designed by the renowned Dutch practice UN Studio, Canaletto is the ‘thinking man’s’ apartment block, aimed at Londoners who want to live and work in the heart of the city. Its steel and glass façade is broken up into clusters, described by the architects as ‘neighbourhoods in the sky’.</p>
<p>This exterior colour palette is complemented by an interior scheme with a more complex modern look, using bold blocks of colour built up through layering.</p>

<p>Our interiors scheme reﬂects the sophisticated nature of this external architecture, utilising engineered materials combined with a very controlled colour palette. An innovative layout optimises the footprint whilst ensuring all principal spaces have views onto the Houses of Parliament.</p>
