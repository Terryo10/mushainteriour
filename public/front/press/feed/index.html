Then really it is about adding to that a sort of sense of drama, the extra elements that can make a home stand out without it being flashy. Hallways become an event, the common areas, the arrival, the concierge, all those sort of things have to function, but ultimately there’s a certain amount of theatre in terms of the arrival.’</em></p>

Credit for this is largely due to their choice of buildings, but the designers play a not insignificant part in the process. In this instance, designers Goddard Littlefair have respectfully interpreted the property’s Townhouse origins to the front; including the lobby, reception and lounges, but have added a degree of modernity to the heart of the hotel that will surprise guests. Namely a beautifully-inspired courtyard ‘Garden’ space and a new bar and restaurant, known as BABA.’</em></p>
