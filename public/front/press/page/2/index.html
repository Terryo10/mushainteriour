This increasingly needs to be recognised in interior spaces too, not only by bringing the outside in through open doors, windows or cut flowers, for example, but via more subtle connections, from tactile, natural materials to art curation choices. In terms of materials, metallic ceramics are starting to come up a lot on our radar, whilst a colour prediction would be subtle citrics, from burnt orange to dusky lemon.’</em><em><br />
