The bar’s name is taken from one of the most elite roses in the world, developed by renowned rose breeder David Austin. As well as lending the concept connotations of craftsmanship, the ‘Rose’ reference is a nod to Rosenheimer Strasse the street onto which the bar’s dedicated entrance faces and Rosenheimer Platz metro station on top of which the hotel stands.</p>
<p>The scheme was inspired by the F&amp;B concept of unusual botanical extracts and the importance of process in the creation of its singular drinks, which includes a range of signature cocktails and what is said to be the best coffee in Munich. The result is an exciting and theatrical zoned space with an alchemical, laboratory feel; a perfect back-drop for outstanding drinks to be made and delivered.</p>

<p><em>“The house we live in is a former coaching inn and would once have welcomed weary travellers with a smile, a bed, stable for the horse, a roaring fire and a flagon of mead. The essence of hospitality is unchanging. It&#8217;s about feeling comfortable and special, about interacting with people and break down barriers, with your host coming out from behind the counter to welcome you. If we can create memorable backdrops for the best doormen and maitre d’s to greet their customers warmly, I’m happy.&#8221; </em></p>

<p><em>‘I immediately recognised the power of light as an essential layer for creating a successful space – adding an accent, highlight or stroke of iridescence that are little short gifts for an interior designer. Light allows us to make certain elements prominent and knock some things back. It can be functional, but also purely decorative.’ </em></p>

Goddard Littlefair were thrilled to be involved in this prestigious project, using a place-making, story-telling approach to connect the look and feel of the suite to the city and to Lowry himself.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Manchester’s rich industrial history, the suite makes reference to the city’s industrial forms, geometry and heritage, including the shape of Trinity Bridge, located directly outside the hotel. Accompanied by a colour palette inspired by Lowry’s five colours, including Yellow Ochre and Prussian Blue, the new design has a luxurious residential feel, with light and bright tonal colours used for the walls, curtains and carpets, offset by darker joinery, with painterly or geometric-patterned fabrics. The completion of the hotel’s presidential suite will be followed by a revamp of the hotel’s lobby and reception, as well as a new look restaurant and bar later this year, also designed by Goddard Littlefair.</p>

<p>Goddard Littlefair Co-founder and Director Jo Littlefair was asked to share her expertise on how to use lighting to create ambience and warmth within the home. <em>“Spotlighting ceilings to death is definitely considered a faux pas when there are so many more intelligent ways to use lighting,”</em>Jo comments, referring to the use of hidden-track lighting in the apartments at One Park Drive, an example of a more subtle form of architectural lighting using directional lights to highlight key elements within the room. <em><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/JAN-The-Times-Bricks-Mortar-One-Park-Drive.jpg"><strong>Click here</strong></a> </em>for the full article.</p>

Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik, situated just above Dubrovnik old town, was originally built in the 1890s and went on to serve the great Mediterranean cruise liners docking in the city in the early 20th century. The brief was to unlock the true potential of the four-storey hotel’s spectacular location, architecture, reputation and history.</p>
<p>Goddard Littlefair was commissioned for a phased set of redesign works, with the first two now completed and including the reception and lobby, The Lobby Lounge, The Imperial Bar, The Executive Lounge, all connecting and guest-room corridors and all of the hotel’s 149 standard and executive rooms and 9 suites. A refurbishment of the hotel’s existing restaurant, Porat, on the lower-ground floor, will follow in late 2019.</p>

Exploring how </span><span style="font-weight: 400">art and accessories </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in hotels can be used to create an authentic sense of place, Richard McCready-Hughes, Creative Director at Goddard Littlefair, tells Hotel Designs how this was achieved at the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square hotel. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Interpreting our client’s brief correctly and effectively is paramount and we conduct in-depth research into market and lifestyle trends to pinpoint exactly what a target market demands,’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Richard explains. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Working on the Principal Edinburgh Charlotte Square, we were briefed to focus on a traveller tribe that wanted all the reassurance of luxury service, but was also looking for </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">a </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sense of authenticity, belonging and assimilation with the city they were visiting. We wanted the hotel to speak immediately to these guests and evoke the sense that they were instinctively ‘understood’ and being welcomed into the home of a much loved, slightly eccentric, family member. Carefully-selected artwork and vintage pieces provide a sense of place, familiarity and nostalgia, but the overall effect is one of warmth and modernity.’</span></i></p>

This increasingly needs to be recognised in interior spaces too, not only by bringing the outside in through open doors, windows or cut flowers, for example, but via more subtle connections, from tactile, natural materials to art curation choices. In terms of materials, metallic ceramics are starting to come up a lot on our radar, whilst a colour prediction would be subtle citrics, from burnt orange to dusky lemon.’</span></i></p>

It took 20 minutes for me to reach my suite. The fascinating art and original memorabilia, conceived by ARTIQ, hang on delicate gold chains as a further reminder of what the hotel walls have witnessed over the years. Although each piece is different, together they tell a tale of rich Scottish tradition, which is further explored in the rooms.’</span></i></p>

The 106-cover venue, conceived of by the team behind Chewton Glen, Lygon Arms, Cliveden and 11 Cadogan Gardens, is made up of a café-bar and extended restaurant, including a wine display area and newly-covered former courtyard space, within the 11 Cadogan Gardens hotel. The restaurant was named in honour of Cadogan family ascendant Sir Hans Sloane, one-time physician to the royal family and President of The Royal Society. This is Goddard Littlefair’s first restaurant project to open in the capital and a great opportunity to show clients a finished F&amp;B project in the same city we work, eat and sleep in – alongside our many completed London residential developments.</p>

Goddard Littlefair Co-Founder and Director Martin Goddard was invited to take part alongside some of the UK’s most prominent designers, brought together to share their thoughts about hospitality design, including trends, technology, heritage and the importance of lighting.</p>
<p>When discussing the topic of uniqueness, Martin suggested that people don’t recognise the brand of the hotel anymore, but instead how the location of the hotel is reflected in its design. <em>“This challenges hotel operators to rethink design, which is really exciting,” </em>he says.<em>“Instead of the brand dictating the design, the locale and heritage dictate the design, and the design consequently becomes the brand”.</em></p>

When asked what drew the company to the project, Martin Goddard answered ‘Chelsea Barracks is just so iconic; its scale is unprecedented’, going on to talk about the excitement of designing for a ‘blank space’, as there are so few finished high-end residential spas of this level of quality and concluding that ‘the intention is that this Spa will offer residents all the advantages of the finest spas in the world, in their own private building’.</p>

A striking and soon-to-be iconic 58-storey circular building by Tate Modern architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, One Park Drive is the first UK residential project by the practice and will be comprised of three apartment typologies – Bay, Cluster and Loft – with all the designs for the Bay and Cluster sections created by Goddard Littlefair. Inspired by the striking use of frames and ribbed textures in the building façade, the interior designs will be crisp and geometric, with an accent on clean lines. The refined and understated colour palettes will be given added drama through shape, texture and finely-judged bolts of vivid colour.</p>

<p>Using our award-winning project The Printing Press Bar &amp; Kitchen as a case study, Michelle and Stuart discussed how the fabric of a building can be both inspirational and prescriptive and the ways in which design can be used to develop and compliment a space.</p>

Our inspiration for the room transformations came from seeing the hotel for the very first time; taking in its scale, presence, grandeur and location, with rolling Scottish hills and an amazing palette of natural colours in every direction. </p>
<p>Our design treatment is rich, varied and interesting with a clear narrative direction and strong connections to the location in terms of materials, colours and art. Guests feel connected to the past via the intrigue and interest of the antiques and art, but also encounter the highest standards of contemporary luxury wherever they look and whatever they touch.</p>
